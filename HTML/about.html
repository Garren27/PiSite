        <p class="bodyContent">I grew up outside of small town along the 401 in South Western Ontario. Throughout high school I was interested in the maths and sciences,
        and took all the courses related to those fields my school had to offer. My teachers encouraged me to continue and learn and recommended that I participate in the
        math contests that ran throughout the year, including the Sir Issac Newton contest from the University of Waterloo. During my year off between high school and University
        I took an online introduction to Java course, and I loved the challenges it presented and how I could solve them using a computer. I applied to the Honours Specialization
        in Computer Science Bachelor of Science Program at Western University for September 2015.</p>

        <p class="bodyContent">
          University started off by teaching us how to adapt to new technologies quickly. We were introduced to Python in the first semester, mainly for procedural
        programming, and then we switched into the object oriented language of Java, which introduced new topics not covered in my online course. Second year did not focus just on
        programming, we were introduced to Software Engineering, Unix OS, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Logic Laws. We were also given our first taste of the Agile
        methodolgy with a group project. My team created a social networking web application which used the Google Maps API to mark where events were happening and
        used a heatmap feature to illustrate how many were in attendance. I was responsible for implementing the event search feature, which allowed users to search for
        events by name and the application would search the Google Firebase database and return possible matches. Our final presentation went very well and the professor
        was impressed with our work. </p>

        <p class="bodyContent">
          Third year continued to teach design patterns and SOLID principles, while also opening more specialized courses like networking, graphics
        and artifical intelligence. Graphics was a particular interest of mine due to my passion for video games, and I enjoyed the challenges of completing the course work input
        in C as it tested my abilites. Artificial intelligence was also very interesting, and the highlight was making a Pacman game that played itself. Another group project
        was given to us where we had to create a web application that worked with Philips Hue Smart Lights to create plans on which they would operate. I worked with the C++
        backend quite extensively in many pair programming sessions in order to complete the project</p>

        <p class="bodyContent">My fourth and final year dealt with more advanced topics. Human Computer Interaction was about how people perceive and work with computers
        and what we as designers can do to make that interactions better. The team project in that class involved converting the city of London's website into
        an iOS application that used principles of design to make the site more user friendly and approachable. Software architecture was another course where
        discussion of the readings was encouraged in lecture. I was the project manager for the group project, where the project involved creating an application
        that implemented a microservice architecture and was deployed on the IBM Cloud platform. I was responsible for completing documentation, organizing meetings,
        programming, and keeping everyone on track. The application itself was developed as a NodeJS application and worked to process and display financial stock
        data from a third party API. The last major team project of the last year was where my team took the Ontario Grade 5 math curriculum and worked closely with
        our supervisor from Western's Faculty of Education to transform it into games in an iOS application that could be used to teach in classrooms. Our application was
        developed using React Native so we could meet the goal of building an iOS application while also leaving the door open for an Android version as well. I worked closely
        with another teammate to set up the database and get the flow of information set up. </p>
